' Cubic BC-spline function

' Some of the values for B and C correspond to well-known filters,
' e.g., B=1 and C=0 corresponds to the cubic B-spline,
' and C=0 results in the family of Duff's tensioned B-splines.
' Setting B=0 and C=-a results in the family of the cardinal splines which were derived by Keys in 1981.
' Using Taylor series expansion they determined that, numerically, the filters for which B + 2 * C = 1 with 0 <= B <= 1
' are the most accurate within that class
' and that the reconstruction error for synthetic examples is proportional to the square of the sampling distance.
' Two new filters were proposed, the first with B=3/2 and C=1/3 suppresses post-aliasing but is unnecessarily blurring,
' the second with B=1/3 and C=1/3 turns out to be a satisfactory compromise between ringing, blurring, and anisotropy.
